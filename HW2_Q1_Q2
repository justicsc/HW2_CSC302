#Hw2 Question 1

#This first one makes a dataframe which then stores data under 3 categories such as name state an sales.
df1=data.frame(Name=c('James','Paul','Richards','Marico','Samantha','Ravi','Raghu',
                      'Richards','George','Ema','Samantha','Catherine'),
               State=c('Alaska','California','Texas','North Carolina','California','Texas',
                       'Alaska','Texas','North Carolina','Alaska','California','Texas'),
               Sales=c(14,24,31,12,13,7,9,31,18,16,18,14))


#This one makes shows a list which includes all the states shown along with the full amount of sales that come
#from each state listed under the sales so Alaska has 39 total sales for example.
aggregate(df1$Sales, by=list(df1$State), FUN=sum)

#This one shows the state and sales but this time it adds a title to each by naming one State and the other
#called sum_sales as you can see with the summarise section. It acts in a way similar to the aggregate
library(dplyr)
df1 %>% group_by(State) %>% summarise(sum_sales = sum(Sales))

#Question 2
df3 = read.csv("C:/Users/justi/OneDrive/Documents/WorldCupMatches.csv", header=T)
#a Find the size of the data frame. How Many rows, how many columns?
head(df3) #just to view whats in the dataframe.
nrow(df3)
ncol(df3)
#B Use summary function to report the statistical summary of your data.
summary(df3)
#c Find how many unique locations olympics were held at.
unique(df3$City)
#d) Find the average attendance.
mean(df3$Attendance, na.rm=TRUE) #Had trouble but got it to show when adding the na.rm=true to it.
#(e) For each Home Team, what is the total number of goals scored? (Hint: Please refer to question 1)
aggregate(df3$Home.Team.Goals, by=list(df3$Home.Team.Name), FUN =sum)
#(f) What is the average number of attendees for each year? Is there a trend or pattern in the data in that sense?
aggregate(df3$Attendance, by=list(df3$Year), FUN = mean)

#Question 3
df4 = read.csv("C:/Users/justi/OneDrive/Documents/metabolite.csv", header=T)
head(df4)
#(a) Find how many Alzheimers patients there are in the data set. (Hint: Please refer to question 1)
df4[df4$label=='Alzheimer', ]

#(b) Determine the number of missing values for each column. (Hint: is.na( ) )
is.na(df4)

#(c) Remove the rows which has missing value for the Dopamine column and assign the result to a new data frame.
#(Hint: is.na( ) )

df5 = df4[is.na(df4['Dopamine'])==TRUE, ]


#(d) In the new data frame, replace the missing values in the c4-OH-Pro column with the median value of the same
#column. (Hint: there is median( ) function.)
